### How does Delphi compare to Codenames?
Being inspired by Codenames, Delphi shares many similarities with Codenames but has a few quirks that make it unique:
- Up to 9 teams with a total of 18 players
- A variable game board size
- *Spymasters* renamed to *Thinkers* and *Operatives* to *Guessers*
- Grouped all the teams' guessing and thinking to save time
- Thinkers make clues with less information
